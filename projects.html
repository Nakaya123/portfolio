How we did this is we used length, width and height to also move around the items to decorate the robots face. A challenge I faced was first figuring out what i was going to use to make this robot. How it was fomated as if you had to drag them feartures you wanted to the face. But instead of that we used code. Once i figured it out I relized I love coding and it was really easy.  </a></span>
